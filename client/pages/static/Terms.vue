          <h4>Billing and Payments</h4>
          <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. In using our services, you may
            be charged local sales tax. By registering to become a member and providing your payment
            information, you agree that we may save your payment information for your
            convenience.</p>
          <p>If your payment method is declined, we will attempt to process your charge until the
            transaction is approved. We, and our third party payment service providers, may request
            and receive, updated credit card information from your credit card issuer, such as
            updated card numbers and expiration date information when your credit card has expired.
            If such updated information is provided to us and our third-party payment service
            providers, we will update your account information accordingly, and will use such
            updated information to process payments for your future purchases and subscriptions.
            Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt out of providing vendors and
            third-party payment service providers with your updated credit card information. If you
            wish to opt out of your credit card’s updating service, you should contact your credit
            card issuer directly.</p>
          <p>We are not responsible for any fees or charges that your bank or credit card issuer may
            apply. If your bank or credit card issuer reverses a charge to your credit card, we may
            bill your account directly and seek payment through another method, including a mailed
            statement.</p>
          <p>The risk of loss and title for items purchased by you through our services passes to you
            upon our delivery of the items to you. Replacement of products or credits to your
            account for shipped merchandise claimed by you as not received are subject to our
            investigation. After our investigation, we may credit your account in our sole
            discretion.</p>
          <h4>Typographical Errors</h4>
          <p>In the event a product is listed on our Site at an incorrect price or with incorrect
            information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information
            provided by our retailers, we have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for
            such products in our sole discretion, whether or not your order has been confirmed and
            your bank or credit card charged. If your bank or credit card has already been charged
            for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will issue a credit to your bank or
            credit card account in the amount of the cancelled charge.</p>
          <h4>Transactions involving Certain Products</h4>
          <p>You may have the option to order delivery of alcohol products in some locations and from
            certain retailers. You will not use Kshop to order alcohol products unless you are 21
            years of age or older and you will not furnish alcohol products obtained through Kshop
            to any person who is not a lawful consumer. You agree that you will comply with all
            applicable laws related thereto and not cause Kshop, your Shopper, or any retailer to
            contravene or violate any applicable law. Kshop may offer information and a method to
            connect duly licensed, participating retailers to you to purchase alcohol beverages.
            Kshop does not, and does not intend to, make sales of alcohol beverages. Each
            participating retailer is the seller of record for the particular products it promotes
            on Kshop and sells to you. Kshop HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR (I) ANY SALE OF
            ALCOHOL PRODUCTS OR DELIVERY OF SUCH PRODUCTS SOLD AND DELIVERED BY RETAILERS TO YOU OR
            ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR THIRD PARTY AND/OR (II) ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF YOU OR ANY
            THIRD PARTY THAT MAY RESULT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PURCHASE AND/OR
            CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL PRODUCTS PROMOTED OR ACQUIRED THROUGH Kshop.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to refuse to offer the delivery of certain
            items. In the event we choose to refuse to offer certain products after you have placed
            your order but before the product is delivered to you, we may cancel the portion of your
            order related to that product and issue a credit to your bank or credit card account in
            the amount of your cancelled charge.</p>

          <h4>Indemnification</h4>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Kshop, its officers, directors,
            employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, liabilities,
            expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from (i)
            your violation of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation, whether or not
            referenced herein, (ii) your violation of any rights of any third party, including
            Shoppers or any party providing services arranged via the Site, or (iii) the use or

            accessing the Site using your Internet account.</p>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <p>These Terms, along with any rules, guidelines or policies published in the Site
            constitute the entire agreement between Kshop and you with respect to your use of the
            Site and the services and products offered through the Site. If there is any conflict
            between the Terms and other rules or instructions posted, the Terms shall control. We
            shall not be liable for damages for any delay or failure of delivery arising out of
            causes beyond our reasonable control and without our fault or negligence, including, but
            not limited to, Acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, riots, wars,
            embargoes, Internet disruptions, hacker attacks, or communications failures. Subject to
            applicable law to the contrary, you agree that any cause of action arising out of or
            related to the use of our Site must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of
            action accrues, or such action will be permanently barred. These Terms shall be governed
            by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of Georgia, without
            reference to its choice and conflict of law rules. You may not assign your rights or
            obligation under these Terms without the prior consent of Kshop. Kshop’s failure to
            insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver
            of any provision or right. All headings included in these Terms are included for
            convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting these Terms. These Terms
            do not limit any rights that Kshop may have pursuant to any intellectual property laws
            or other laws. All rights and remedies available to Kshop, pursuant to these Terms or
            otherwise, at law or in equity, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or
            remedies that may be available. No independent contractor relationship, partnership,
            joint venture, employer-employee or franchise relationship is created by these
            Terms.</p>
