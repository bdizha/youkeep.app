              is
              made between you (either an individual or, if you are using Addtract on behalf of an entity, that entity)
              and
              Addtract.com, Inc. It governs your access to and use of Addtract’s services, products, software, and
              websites (the “<strong>Services</strong>”).
            </p>

            <p>If your Order Form contains additional terms and conditions, then those terms and conditions govern to
              the
              extent they conflict with any of these terms. If you are agreeing to these terms on behalf of an entity,
              you
              represent that you have the authority to bind that organization, otherwise you must not sign up for the
              Services.</p>

            <p><em>Please read this agreement carefully. It requires the use of binding individual arbitration to
              resolve
              disputes rather than jury trials or class actions (for information about how to opt-out, see Section 11.8
              (30-day opt-out period) below).</em></p>

            <p>Addtract’s bookkeeping services are a solution for bookkeeping and marketplace organization. Addtract’s

            <h3 id="12-certain-year-end-services">1.2 Certain Year-End Services</h3>

            <p>If you are a Addtract Bookkeeping customer for the quarter following the calendar year end (i.e., your
              subscription has not been terminated during such period), Addtract will perform certain year-end
              bookkeeping
              activities at that time as part of your subscription, including making year-end annual adjustments and
              providing a trial balance and standard full-year marketplace statements for your tax returns. If you are
              not
              a
              Addtract Bookkeeping customer for the quarter following the calendar year end, Addtract will not perform
              such
              year-end bookkeeping activities and bears no responsibility or liability with respect to any failure to
              perform such activities on your behalf.</p>

            <p>We use Intuit Inc.’s Quickbooks Online™ to provide the Services. If you don’t already have an account, we
              will create one for you. Your and our use of Quickbooks Online™ will be governed by Intuit’s <a

            <p>Our Services can automatically transfer data from other websites and services, like your bank account. If
              you
              provide us with login credentials (for example, an account name or number, password, answers to security
              questions (collectively, the “<strong>Login Credentials</strong>”)), you both (a) give us permission, and
              a
              limited power of attorney, to use them to login to these other websites and services and access, transfer,
              reformat, and manipulate your account on your behalf; and (b) represent to us that you have the authority
              to
              give us this permission. We will maintain Login Credentials in encrypted form, and we will only use them
              as

            <h3 id="15-unauthorized-uses-of-the-services">1.5. Unauthorized uses of the Services</h3>

            <p>You will only use the Services in accordance with the <a href="/terms">Addtract Acceptable Use
              Policy</a>. We may suspend or terminate provision of the Services, in whole or in part, where we believe
              it is
              being used in a manner that breaches this agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) or creates risk
              of
              personal injury, property damage, or legal liability for Addtract, you or any third party, or may cause
              Addtract to
              lose the services of one of our third-party service providers. You represent and warrant that any
              information
              you provide to us about your (or, if you are acting on behalf of another, that person’s) business,

            <h3 id="16-modifications-to-the-services">1.6. Modifications to the Services</h3>

            <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionality or features,
              and we
              may suspend or stop part of the Services altogether.</p>

            <h3 id="17-facilities-and-data-transfer">1.7. Facilities and data transfer</h3>

            <p>All facilities used to store and process Customer Data will adhere to reasonable security standards no
              less
              protective than the security standards at facilities where Addtract stores and processes its own
              information of a
              similar type. As part of providing the Services, we may transfer, store and process Customer Data in the
              United States. By using the Services, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of Customer
              Data.</p>

            <h3 id="18-exclusivity">1.8. Exclusivity</h3>

            <p>If you are a Addtract Bookkeeping customer, you acknowledge and agree that in performing the Services,
              Addtract
              must use, record, classify and reconcile your marketplace transactions and other data to prepare your
              books.
              For
              example, depending upon the Services, Addtract may have to: (a) import transactions from your books in
              order to
              reconcile your bank accounts, (b) categorize transactions in your books to expense accounts and to balance
              sheet accounts for amortization purposes and/or (c) sync your payroll data via the Gusto sync. Any
              modifications made by you or on your behalf (e.g., by a third party service provider other than Addtract)
              to your
              books may adversely impact Services previously performed by Addtract, causing Addtract to have to
              re-perform
              such
              Services in order to correct any resulting inconsistencies or inaccuracies or to confirm that there are no
              such inconsistencies or inaccuracies. To avoid these types of situations that are undesirable not only for
              Addtract, but also for you, you hereby appoint Addtract as your exclusive third-party bookkeeper. If you
              engage
              another third-party service provider to make changes to your books, or you otherwise make changes to your
              books directly, while you have engaged Addtract to provide the Services, Addtract reserves the right to
              terminate
              your subscription at any time upon written notice without a refund of prepaid fees for unelapsed months of
              the
              Services.</p>

              will
              use the other party’s Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this

              disclosure if
              the recipient is informed that (a) it is legally prohibited from giving notice or (b) the Legal Process
              relates to exceptional circumstances involving danger of death or serious physical injury.</p>

            <h4 id="323-opposition">3.2.3. Opposition</h4>

            <p>The recipient and its Affiliates will comply with the other party’s reasonable requests to oppose

              the
              term specified on your Order Form (the “<strong>Initial Term</strong>”).</p>

              support@addtract.com) at least (a) seven (7) days for monthly or quarterly subscriptions; or (b) thirty
              (30) days

              you
              with
              thirty (30) days’ advance notice of such increase to the email address associated with your account. If
              you do
              not terminate your subscription within such thirty (30)-day period, your continued use of the Service
              constitutes your agreement to pay, and your authorization for us to collect payment from you in accordance

              the
              Intuit Quickbooks Online account that was maintained for you by Addtract, so that you can elect to
