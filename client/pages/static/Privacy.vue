          <p>Thank you for using Owami! This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those
            who are concerned with how their information is being used online. Please read our
            privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or
            otherwise handle any information that we may collect from you or that you may provide
            when you use our Platform.</p>
          <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
          <h4>Information That You Give Us</h4>
          <p>We receive, store and process information, including personally identifiable information,
            that you make available to us when accessing or using the Owami Platform and Services.
            Examples include information you provide when you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fill in any form on the Platform, such as when you register or update the details of
              your user account, or when you supply ID and other verification information;
            </li>
            <li>access or use the Platform, such as to place grocery orders, search for products,
              pay for your order, place special orders; and
            </li>
            <li>communicate with Owami.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Information we get from your Use of our Platform</h4>
          <p>Cookies, Pixels, and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our partners use various
            technologies to collect information, including cookies, pixels, and device identifiers.
            Cookies are small text files that are sent by your computer when you access our services
            through a browser. We may use session cookies (which expire when you close your
            browser), persistent cookies (which expire when you choose to clear them from your
            browser), pixels, and other identifiers to collect information from your browser or
            device that helps us do things such as understand how you use our services, personalize
            your experience, measure advertising performance, and remember that you are logged in to
            Owami.</p>
          <p>Mobile Data: When you use certain features of the Platform, in particular our mobile
            applications we may receive, store and process different types of information about your
            location, including general information (e.g. IP address, zip code) and more specific
            information (e.g. GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Platform
            or specific features of the platform). If you access the Platform through a mobile
            device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information,
            you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided
            your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for
            further details.</p>
          <p>We employ some third-party services to help us understand the usage of Owami, and these
            third-parties may also deploy cookies or pixels on our site or collect information
            through our mobile applications. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand how
            users interact with various portions of our site.</p>
          <p>Log information: When you use Owami, our servers will record information about your usage
            of the service and information that is sent by your browser or device. Logs information
            can include things like the IP address of your device, information about the browser,
            operating system and/or app you are using, unique device identifiers, pages that you
            navigate to and links that you click, searches that you run on Owami, and other ways you
            interact with the service. When you are logged into the Owami service, this information
            is stored with your account information.</p>
          <h2>What do we do with your information?</h2>

            </li>
            <li>We may provide personal information to the merchants who fulfill the orders you

            </li>
            <li>We may share personal information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and marketing
              partners.
            </li>
            <li>We may share aggregated, anonymized or de-identified personal information with any
              third party, without any restriction, including through the use of cookies and other
              automated technologies.
            </li>
            <li>To operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, Owami’s business and our

            </li>
            <li>To send you marketing, advertising, and promotional messages and other information
              that may be of interest to you, including information about Owami, our services, or
              general promotions for partner campaigns and services;
            </li>
            <li>To administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other
              promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by Owami or our Third Party

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Third-party services</h2>
          <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
            information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide
            to us.</p>
          <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other
            payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
            information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
            For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
            understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these
            providers.</p>
          <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that
            are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed
            with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then
            your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that
            service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
          <p>As an example, if you are a Canadian citizen and your transaction is processed by a
            payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in
            completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States
            legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
          <p>This privacy policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including
            through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be
            accessible from our site.</p>
          <h2>Disclosure</h2>
          <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you
            violate our Terms of Service.</p>
          <h2>Links</h2>
          <p>When you click on links on our website or blog, they may direct you away from our site.
            We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to
            read their privacy statements.</p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry
            best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed,
            disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
          <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption. &nbsp;Although
            no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we
            follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry
            standards.</p>
          <h2>Your California privacy rights</h2>
          <p>Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to
            request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to
            which Owami has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct
            marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law
            provides that if a company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out”
            choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the
            company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure
            choice options.</p>
          <p>This site qualifies for the alternative option. Its privacy policy provides you with
            information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third
            parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or
            disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the
            preceding year for marketing purposes.</p>
          <p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third
            party disclosure choices, send a request to the following email address: <em><a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181025162848/mailto:info@Owami.com">info@Owami.com</a></em>.
          </p>
          <h2>Children online privacy protection act</h2>
          <p>The site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may
            provide any information through the site. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any
            information through the site or on or through any of its features. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children under 13; however, if we learn we have
            collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of
            parental consent, we will delete that information. Please contact us if you believe we
            might have personal information about a child under age 13.</p>
          <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
          <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it
            frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting
            on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that
            it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use
            it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.</p>
          <p>If Owami is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred
            to the new owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.</p>
          <h2>Questions and contact information</h2>
          <p>If you would like to access, correct, amend or delete any personal information we have
            about you, register a complaint, or simply want more information about our privacy
            practices, please contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at info@Owami.com or by mail
