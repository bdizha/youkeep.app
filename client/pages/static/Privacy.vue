            <p>This Privacy Statement describes in greater detail the privacy practices of Brickcent.com, Inc.</p>

            <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Statement or practices, please contact us at
              support@Brickcent.com.</p>

            <p><strong>1. WHEN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT APPLIES.</strong></p>

            <p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively,
              “Services”) that link to this Statement.</p>

            <p><strong>2. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and
              how
              we use it to deliver our Services to you, operate our business, and help make our Services work better for
              you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses
              without your consent.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>a) Types of Information We Collect.</strong> In connection with accessing our Services, we may
              collect information from you which can be used to identify you (“Personal Information”), such as your
              name,
              billing address, email address, phone, username, password, and marketplace data.</p>

            <p>We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service,
              call
              us for support, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties,
              such
              as when you sync a third party account or service with your Brickcent Service, or when we may use service
              providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help
              us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect
              content
              or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.</p>

            <p>We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services (“Usage Data”),
              such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser
              type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected
              from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we may collect IP addresses to track and
              aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users
              navigate to our Services. We may also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as
              part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect
              Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.</p>

            <p>Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different
              types
              of information.</p>

            <p><strong>b) How We Use Your Information.</strong> We may use your information, including your Personal
              Information, for the following purposes:</p>

            <p><em>Account Registration</em>. We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register
              your account for certain Services we provide and to communicate important information to you. We may
              obtain
              additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available
              sources, to keep our records current. If you set up an account that may be accessed by people other than
              you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information.</p>

            <p><em>To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business</em>. We may use your information to operate our
              business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services,
              and
              to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.</p>

            <p><em>Customer Service and Technical Support</em>. We may use your name, address, phone number, email
              address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your computer configuration to resolve
              questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience. We may also
              offer
              various Internet chat services, for example, to speak with an Brickcent support representative. Internet
              Chat
              transmissions are encrypted but you should not supply more Personal Information, including tax data, than
              is
              required to address your specific issue. A transcript of the session may be retained to resolve questions
              or
              issues related to our Services.</p>

            <p><em>Communicate with You and Tell You About Other Services</em>. We may use your information to
              communicate
              with you about our Services and to give you offers for third party products and services that we think may
              be of use to you. Please see below under “What You Can Do to Manage Your Privacy” for the choices you have
              regarding these communications.</p>

            <p><em>To Improve Services and Develop New Services</em>. We will use your information to personalize or
              customize your experience and the Service, develop new features or services, and to improve the overall
              quality of Brickcent’s Services.</p>

            <p><em>Feedback</em>. We may use any information you volunteer in surveys you answer for us and combine them
              with answers from other customers in order to better understand our Services and how we may improve them.
              Answering any survey is optional.</p>

            <p><em>Research, Including Publishing or Sharing Combined Information from Many Users, But Only in a Way
              that
              Would Not Allow You or Any Other Person to be Identified</em>. Only in a way that would not allow you or
              any
              other person to be identified, we may prepare and share information about our customers with third
              parties,
              such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes. For
              example,
              we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use mobile services or
              who
              use a particular operating system. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated
              findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be
              identified.</p>

            <p><strong>c) How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong> From time to time, we may need to share your
              Personal Information with others.</p>

            <p><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. We may share your information, including Personal Information and
              Usage Data, with third party service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our
              Services and help us operate our business, such as website design, sending email communications, fraud
              detection and prevention, customer care, or performing analytics. Our contracts with these third parties
              require them to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them, only act on
              our
              behalf and under our instructions, and not use Personal Information for purposes other than the product or
              service they’re providing to us or on our behalf.</p>

            <p><em>Response to Subpoenas and Other Legal Requests</em>. We may share your information with courts, law
              enforcement agencies, or other government bodies when we have a good faith belief we’re required or
              permitted to do so by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect
              our company, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other law enforcement request.
            </p>

            <p><em>Protection of Brickcent and Others</em>. We may share account information, Personal Information and
              Usage
              Data when we believe it is appropriate to enforce or apply our products’ Terms of Service and other
              agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Brickcent, our Services, our users, or others.
              This
              includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit
              risk
              reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information
              of
              our customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Statement.
            </p>

            <p><em>Reporting to Credit Bureaus</em>. We may share your information with credit bureaus, consumer
              reporting
              agencies, and card associations. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be
              reflected in your credit report and consumer report. We may also share your information with other
              companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents, government agencies, and card associations in connection with
              issues related to fraud, credit, or debt collection.</p>

            <p><em>Sale of Our Business</em>. If we sell, merge, or transfer any part of our business, we may be
              required
              to share your information. If so, you will be asked if you’d like to stop receiving promotional
              information
              following any change of control.</p>

            <p><em>With your Consent</em>. Other than as set out above, we will provide you with notice and the
              opportunity to choose when your Personal Information may be shared with other third parties.</p>

            <p><strong>d) Syncing, Linking, Connecting Your Bank Account or Other Third Party Services with Your
              Brickcent
              Service.</strong></p>

            <p>You may choose to sync certain Brickcent Services with information from other marketplace accounts. To
              sync
              your
              marketplace account information, we must access your online account with your marketplace institution. We
              will
              request your user name, password, and any other login data that you have set up with your marketplace
              institution to enable access. We use this information to update and maintain the account information you
              download, to assist with the download process, and to enhance the Services we may provide in the
              future.</p>

            <p>We work with other companies or developers to offer you products and services and you may choose to sync,
              link or connect other third party services with your Brickcent Service. Sometimes Brickcent may let you
              know
              about
              the service or product, or another company may let you know about a Brickcent service or product. It will
              be
              clear who is referring the service or product, and who is providing the service or product. If you choose
              to
              accept these services, providing your consent to either the third party or to us, we may exchange your
              information, including your Personal Information, as well as information about how you interact with each
              company’s service or product. This exchange of information is necessary to maintain business operations
              and
              to provide the ongoing service you’ve requested. By requesting or accepting these products or services,
              you
              are permitting us to provide your information, including your Personal Information, to the other
              party.</p>

            <p>One company we work with is Plaid. You hereby consent to give Plaid the right, power, and authority to
              act
              on your behalf to access and transmit to us information from your synced marketplace accounts. You
              acknowledge
              and agree that such information will be treated by Plaid in accordance with Plaid’s privacy policy, which
              is
              available at: <a href="https://plaid.com/legal/#Privacy-Policy"
              >https://plaid.com/legal/#Privacy-Policy</a>.
            </p>

            <p><strong>3. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MANAGE YOUR PRIVACY. You can view and edit information that identifies you
              online through your Brickcent Service. How you can access and control information that identifies you will
              depend on which Services you use. You have a choice about the use of information that identifies you,
              marketing communications you receive from us, and our use of cookies and other tracking
              technologies.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>a) Updating Your Personal Information.</strong> In connection with your right to manage your
              Personal Information you provide to us, you may access, update, change, correct or request deletion of
              your
              information either through the Service or through our customer support. You can reach our customer support
              by using the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this statement.</p>

            <p><strong>b) Managing Marketing Communications From Us.</strong> We will honor your choices when it comes
              to
              receiving marketing communications from us. Remember that even if you choose not to receive marketing
              communications from us, we will continue to send you mandatory service or transactional communications.
            </p>

            <p><strong>c) Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> The following is a high level summary of our
              practices and your controls for cookies and other tracking technologies.</p>

            <p>In accordance with applicable law, Brickcent and our service providers may use commonly-used tools to
              recognize
              your visit and track your interactions with our Services such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local
              shared
              objects, and similar technologies (collectively, “Cookies”). Sometimes this tracking is necessary in order
              for us to provide you the Service you requested. Other times, we combine Usage Data collected from Cookies
              with that of other customers to improve your and other customers’ experience. You have control over some
              of
              the Usage Data we collect from Cookies and how we use it. Information on changing your browser settings to
              opt out of Cookies can be found in your browser settings. If you opt-out and later delete your Cookies,
              use
              a different browser, or buy a new computer, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.</p>

            <p><strong>d) Do Not Track.</strong> Like most other companies, our Services are not currently configured to
              respond to browsers’ “Do Not Track” signals because at this time no formal “Do Not Track” standard has
              been
              adopted.</p>

            <p><strong>e) Social Media Features.</strong> Our Services may use social media features, such as Facebook
              sharing (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are
              visiting within our Service, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media
              Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with
              these
              features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing the relevant Social Media
              Features.
            </p>

            <p><strong>4. DATA RETENTION AND YOUR ACCESS RIGHTS</strong></p>

            <p><strong>a) Data Retention.</strong> In accordance with and as permitted by applicable law and
              regulations,
              we will retain your information as long as necessary to serve you, to maintain your account for as long as
              your account is active, or as otherwise needed to operate our business. When you close your account, we
              may
              continue to communicate with you about our Services, give you important business updates that may affect
              you, and let you know about products and services that may interest you, unless you have opted out of
              receiving marketing communications. We may also continue to use some of your information for business
              purposes and to improve our offerings or in some cases to develop new ones. We will retain and use your
              information as required by applicable regulations and Brickcent’s records and information management
              policies
              to
              comply with our legal and reporting obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, complete any
              outstanding transactions and for the detection and prevention of fraud.</p>

            <p><strong>b) Your Access Rights.</strong> As required by applicable law, you may contact us to confirm
              whether we maintain, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information and to review
              it in order to verify its accuracy and the lawfulness of our processing of such Personal Information.
              Where
              you have determined that the Personal Information we collected about you is inaccurate or processed in
              violation of applicable law, you may also request that your Personal Information be corrected, amended, or
              deleted. Requests for access to your Personal Information and to have it corrected, amended, or deleted
              should be sent to support@Brickcent.com.</p>

            <p><strong>5. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION. Keeping your Information safe is important to us.</strong></p>

              service providers operate.</p>
